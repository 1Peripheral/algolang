## Pseudo code looking toy language
I made this project as a proof of concept as well as to learn more about compilers/interpreters.

### About the language
This language uses tree walking interpretation .

## Syntax
```python
read x as number
read y as number
f = 10
if x + y > 10 then
    write "BIG IF TRUE"
end
```
